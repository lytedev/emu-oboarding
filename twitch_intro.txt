Hi! I'm working on an online ARG/"pen and paper"-style RPG. The app I'm working
on now is the introduction to my players about the game.

The concept is that incredibly powerful godlike aliens have existed for a long
time and protected young planets with life such as earth. They have since
pretty much killed eachother off. However, the tech and power remains...

The players will be contacted by an old and glitchy A.I that is supposed to
reach out to worlds once they reach a certain technological point (interstellar
travel) and introduce the universe at large. Due to a glitch, it reaches out to
my players and gives them control of avatars. The game will play via email or
chat or a web app that I make (iterations on the play interface can be
explained as the A.I learning to better serve its users). Errors or slowness on
my part can be explained by A.I glitches or immense
interplanetary/intergalactic latencies. Gameplay will, at its most basic
levels, be just like playing DnD online.
